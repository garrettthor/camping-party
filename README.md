Welcome to the CAMPING PARTY!

This app will help groups of campers:
    -Know who's going on a trip
    -Create an inventory list
        *Check off items that you have
        *Request things you're missing from other campers
        *Differentiate between group items (like a cooler) and individual items (like your socks)
        *See if a group member is missing something crucial that maybe you could lend them ("Hey, bud, need a tent?")
    -View the current weather for the destination
        *(historical records for same date?)

    -Possible systems:
        *"make a point" system to flag any item and start a comment conversation on it
            -Highlights an inventory item for example "Do we reaaaally need 5 coolers?"
            -Draw attention to a weather item
            -Question if a party member is REALLY gonna show this time, or flake like usual?
